# Initial thoughts; to be updated



# my goal:

1. Create a model that predicts whether a (potential) new partner might fall into a specifc category or how good the partner might be
1.5 this will most likely be a classification task

In order for a classification task to work, we need to work out a couple of predictors that can be observed from the get go and also predict good performance later on
2. as such, as a precursor, an analysis of important features to PREDICT future performance in terms of transactions and new customers should be conducted, where the outcome might be a combination of multiple variables such as: new_customers and total_transactions and frequency_of_new_trancactions. Possible predictors for this taks might be: (possible) inverse distance of this partner to all others, google ratings, City, how many vytal partners,
